# Colored blocks

Display three colored blocks on a page one below another. Each block
must be 100 pixels high and span the entire width of the page.
The top block must be red, the middle one must be green, and the bottom one
must be blue.

Your browser will add a narrow margin to the `<body>` element by default. Remove
it so that there is no space between the edges of the page and the blocks.

You can find some sample screenshots in the `backstop_data/bitmaps_reference` folder.

## The task
Display three colored blocks on a page one below another.
 
- Each block must be 100 pixels high and span the entire width of the page.
- The top block must be red, the middle one must be green, and the bottom one must be blue.
- Your browser will add a narrow margin to the `<body>` element by default. Remove it so that there is no space between the edges of the page and the blocks.

You can find some sample screenshots in the `backstop_data/bitmaps_reference` folder.
